# To create a shell script that finds bloated tables in a Greenplum database, you can utilize the pgstattuple extension, which provides statistics about the physical size and bloat in database tables. Below is an example of a shell script to find bloated tables in a Greenplum database:

# Install the pgstattuple extension if it's not already installed:

# Connect to the Greenplum database as a superuser (or a user with superuser privileges)
psql -h your_greenplum_host -p your_greenplum_port -U your_superuser -d your_database_name

# Install the pgstattuple extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgstattuple;

#!/bin/bash

# Replace the variables with your Greenplum connection details
DB_HOST="your_greenplum_host"
DB_PORT="your_greenplum_port"
DB_NAME="your_greenplum_database"
DB_USER="your_greenplum_user"
DB_PASSWORD="your_greenplum_password"

# Threshold for table bloat (in percentage)
BLOAT_THRESHOLD=10

# Function to find bloated tables in the Greenplum database
find_bloated_tables() {
    # Connect to the database and execute the query to find bloated tables
    psql -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME << EOF
SELECT schemaname || '.' || relname AS table_name,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(C.oid)) AS total_size,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_table_size(C.oid)) AS table_size,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size(C.oid)) AS index_size,
       bloat_ratio
FROM (
  SELECT C.oid,
         CASE WHEN pg_total_relation_size(C.oid) > 0 THEN
              (pg_total_relation_size(C.oid) - pg_table_size(C.oid)) * 100 / pg_total_relation_size(C.oid)
         ELSE 0
         END AS bloat_ratio
  FROM pg_class C
  LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
  WHERE nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
    AND relkind='r'
) AS bloat
JOIN pg_class C ON (C.oid = bloat.oid)
WHERE bloat_ratio > $BLOAT_THRESHOLD
ORDER BY bloat_ratio DESC;
